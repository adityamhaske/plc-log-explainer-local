It is recommended to inspect the wiring for any visible damage, and verify the integrity of the PLC program.\\nFor instance, if a sensor's wiring has become disconnected or corroded, it may cause erratic behavior leading to the triggered alarm.\",\"actions\":\"To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps:\\n1. Power off the machine and make sure all safety precautions are followed.\\n2. Inspect the wiring of sensors related to ALM_3021 for any signs of damage or corrosion.\\n3.
